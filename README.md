This GUI is based on the Random Forest (RF) model developed for distinguishing seismic events from other recording types (i.e., blast and noise records) based on the microseismic monitoring database compiled from Vivien Gold Mine in Western Australia. For more information regarding this study, parameters, and model development procedure, please refer to link below:  ....coming soon...
Please download the zip file of the GUI from the "Releases" section and run "Classification_GUI.exe".
